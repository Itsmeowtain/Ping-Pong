# Ping-Pong
Multiplayer Ping-pong game

YOU MUST HAVE JRE OR JDK (Java 8 OR newer) downloaded for the program to work

When you first boot up the game, there are 3 options that will appear on the screen

* If you want to play singleplayer, you may leave the IP address bar blank

* In order to play the game Multiplayer:
1. Input your local IP address if you are the game host
2. Then, the client (your friend or colleague) can be provided with the IP address, and the game will start

* I also added a settings menu on the most recent version where you can change whether you are host or client
  and change the volume.
